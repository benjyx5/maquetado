        <h2><a id="1-introduction"  href="#1-introduction"></a><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms") carefully as they govern your use of (which includes access to) Spotify's personalized services for streaming music and other content, including all of our websites and software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms (collectively, the "Spotify Service") and any music, videos, podcasts, audiobooks, or other material that is made available through the Spotify Service ("Content").
            <br>
            <br>
            Use of the Spotify Service is subject to the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/privacy-policy/">Spotify Privacy Policy</a> and additional terms and conditions presented by Spotify, all of which are made part of these Terms by this reference.
            <br>
            <br>
            By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.
            <br>
            <br>
            THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 6 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. IN ARBITRATION THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.

        <h3>Spotify Service options</h3>
        <p>
            We provide numerous Spotify Service options. Certain Spotify Service options are provided free of charge, while other options require payment before they can be accessed ("Paid Subscriptions"). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.
        </p>
        <h3>Trials</h3>
        <p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate ("Trial"). By using a Spotify Service via a Trial, you agree to the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/paid-subscription-terms/">Spotify Paid Subscription Terms.</a></p>

        <h3>Creating a Spotify account</h3>
        <p>
            You may need to create a Spotify account to use all or part of the Spotify Service. Your username and password are for your personal use only and should be kept confidential. You understand that you are responsible for all use (including any unauthorized use) of your username and password. Notify our <a href="https://accounts.spotify.com/en/login?nosignup=true&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.spotify.com%2Fus%2Fcontact-spotify-support%2F%3F_ga%3D2.242801345.2113527512.1615794512-1876599584.1615794512%26_gl%3D1*aoaqdk*_gcl_au*MTE2MTI2MDI5Ny4xNzA2NTY2Mjk5">Customer Service</a> team immediately if your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe there has been unauthorized access to your account.
            <br>
            <br>
            Spotify may reclaim, or require you to change, your username for any reason.

       <h3>User Content</h3>
       <h4>The content you post on the Spotify Service</h4>
       <p>
            Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Spotify Service ("User Content"). For the avoidance of doubt, User Content includes all information, materials and other content that is added, created, uploaded, submitted, distributed, or posted to the Spotify Service (including to the <a href="https://community.spotify.com/?_gl=1*1ht43g1*_gcl_au*MTE2MTI2MDI5Ny4xNzA2NTY2Mjk5">Spotify Support Community</a>) by users.
            <br>
            <br>
            You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post.
            <br>
            <br>
            You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content; and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify pursuant to the license granted below, does not: (i) violate these Terms, including the Spotify User Guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property or other rights of any third party; or (ii) imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, or other individual or entity without the prior express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.

        <h3>Suspending and terminating the Spotify Service</h3>
        <p>
            These Terms will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify. Spotify may terminate these Terms (including any additional terms and conditions incorporated herein) or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time if we believe you have breached any of these Terms, if we stop providing the Spotify Service or any material component thereof, or as we believe necessary to comply with applicable law. If you or Spotify terminate these Terms, or if Spotify suspends your access to the Spotify Service, you agree that Spotify shall have no liability or responsibility to you, and (except as expressly provided in these Terms) Spotify will not refund any amounts that you have already paid. You may terminate these Terms at any time, in which case you may not continue accessing or using the Spotify Service. To learn how to terminate your Spotify account, please use the Customer Support resources on our About Us page.
            <br>
            <br>
            The following sections shall survive termination: Sections 2 (The Spotify Service), 3 (Your Use of the Spotify Service) (except as set forth therein), 4 (Content and Intellectual Property Rights), 6 (Problems and Disputes), 7 (About These Terms), as well as any other sections of these Terms that, either explicitly or by their nature, must remain in effect even after termination of these Terms.
        </p>
        <h2><a id="7-about-these-therms"  href="#7-about-these-therms"></a><strong>7. About These Terms</strong></h2>
        <p>
            Under applicable law, you may have certain rights that can't be limited by a contract. These Terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.
        </p>
        <h3>Changes</h3>
        <p>
            We may make changes to these Terms (including any additional Spotify terms and conditions incorporated by reference herein) from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting the revised Terms on the applicable Spotify Service (provided that, for material changes, we will seek to supplement such notice by email, an in-service pop-up message, or other prominent notice within the Spotify Service, or other means). Your use of the Spotify Service following any changes to these Terms will constitute your acceptance of such changes. Premium Subscribers who do not wish to continue using the Spotify Service under the updated Terms must close their Spotify account prior to their renewal date or thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, whichever occurs first. If Spotify makes any material change to the Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the notice address), you may reject any such change by sending us a personally signed, written notice of your decision to opt out of those changes via email to tounotice@spotify.com. This opt-out notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of when we notify users of the change and include: (1) your name, address, email address associated with your Spotify account, phone number, and Spotify username. Such an opt-out must be sent by you personally from your personal email address, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. The opt-out notice also must include a statement that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement is not an opt-out of arbitration altogether. Even if you opt out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement, you and Spotify agree that any Dispute will be determined by binding individual (not class) arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement in effect immediately before any such opt-out.
